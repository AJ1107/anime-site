    <p>Hey, I know you’re probably still angry with me and you don’t want to talk to me, but I need you to hear me out.
        I’m really sorry for what I did to you and I regret it more than anything. I know that I was wrong and foolish,
        and I have no excuse for my actions. You are a wonderful person who deserves to be loved and cherished, and I
        failed to do that. You have every right to be mad at me, but please don’t shut me out. I don’t want to lose you
        over this. I’m not asking you to forget what I did, but I’m hoping you can forgive me and give me another
        chance. Please tell me what you want me to do, and I’ll do it. You’re the one who made me happy. I need to talk
        to you and explain myself. Please give me a chance to make things right and show you how much I Care About Us.
        Please call me or text me back as soon as you can. and I’ll do anything to make you smile again I’m waiting for
        your reply and I won’t give up on you.”</p>
